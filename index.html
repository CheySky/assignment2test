        In December 2016, True Fitness opened a centre at Velocity, occupying the premises of the ex-California Fitness. 
This Novena branch is their 8<sup>th</sup> center, bringing their local presence to a massive 183,000 square feet of fitness and yoga space in Singapore. 
To better serve members, the new gym will feature an Infra-Red Hot Yoga studio, private yoga studio, functional training space & equipment to cater to growing sophisticated fitness needs.
Other services and facilities available include cardio, strength and resistance, functional training equipment, free weights, Group Exercise studios, as well as a Spinning studio.
    <br>
	Being directly above Novena MRT station, in close proximity to Orchard as well as the Central Business District, it is hoped that this centre will offer members greater accessibility and convenience.
